## ZIP Archive
When installing DBeaver manually, without using an installer:

- Extract the contents of the archive.
NOTE: Do not unzip the archive over a previous DBeaver version. If you already have any version of DBeaver extracted in the same location - remove it before unzipping the new version.
NOTE: All configurations, scripts and other necessary data are stored in a separate location (usually in the user`s home directory) so the program deinstallation does not affect them.

- Run the dbeaver executable.
